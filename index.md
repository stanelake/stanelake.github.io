 Hello guys...


This blog will be a doodle pad where I will update my mathematics and computing experiences.


Currently, I am a PhD Mathematics and Computing candidate at Universitat de Barcelona and an MSc Financial Engineering student at WorldQuant University.


My desire is to document my experiences for me to come back to them later.


The interesting things I have come across include:

    Econometrics
    Discrete and continuous time stochastic processes
    Levy processes
    Python and C++ programming
    

Let's see how this will go.
