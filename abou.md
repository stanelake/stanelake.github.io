# About

Am a Mathematics graduate working on data science applications and the pricing of options. This blog will be a doodle pad where I will update my data science, mathematics and computing experiences.

My desire is to document my experiences for me to come back to them later.

The interesting things I have worked on include:

    Econometrics
    Machine Learning
    Discrete and continuous time stochastic processes
    Python and R programming
    Financial Mathematics in general

I desire to transition from academia into applied data driven research in the financial markets.
