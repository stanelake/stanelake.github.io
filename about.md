# About

Am a current PhD Mathematics student working on the pricing of options on volatile assets. We apply stochastic volatility and Levy processes to model the asset prices and apply 'decomposition' techniques to reduce the complexity of the pricing. This increases the model flexibility and reduces the computational time to obtain prices.

In addition, in order to acquire work ready skills, I am currently enrolled in an MSc Financial Engineering course and my current GPA is "Excellent".

I desire to transition from academia into applied research in the financial markets.

#Some Projects I have Done:

##On the pricing of options in the Heston-CEV stochastic volatility model
In this paper a hybrid model that takes the strengths of the Heston and the CEV models is considered. The pricing of European options is investigated. A decomposition formula that allows to estimate the option price is obtained. Moreover, numerical simulations of the asset price are done. In addition, the price of the European call option under the hybrid stochastic volatility model is simulated using the Monte Carlo method. Several graphs of the solutions are given.

##A Hybrid stochastic volatility model in a Levy Market

This paper deals with the pricing and the hedging of financial options in a hybrid stochastic volatility model with jumps. We propose a hybrid Heston-CEV model driven by a L\'evy process. Under these settings the market is incomplete, which leads to the existence of infinitely many risk-neutral measures. In order to price the option, the set of all risk-neutral measures is determined. Moreover, the PIDE of the option price is derived using Itô formula. Furthermore, Malliavin-Skorohod Calculus is utilized to hedge the portfolio and to compute the price sensitivities. The obtained results generalize the existing pricing and hedging formulas for the Heston as well as for the CEV stochastic volatility models.
 

##Decomposition of the option pricing formula for jump-diffusion stochastic volatility models with infinite activity jumps

Let the log returns of an asset be defined on a risk neutral filtered probability space  for some finite T. Assume that the returns process X is a stochastic volatility jump diffusion model with infinite activity jumps. We use Itô calculus techniques to obtain versions of the Alòs-type decompositions of the option pricing formula by applying two approaches found in literature. Moreover, we use this decomposition to obtain approximations of option prices for some examples of Levy processes.
