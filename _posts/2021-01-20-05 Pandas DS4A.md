# Data Analysis: Loan data
1. TOC
{:toc}

In the fourth quarter of 2020 I tried to enrole for a diploma/fellowship at [Correlation One](https://www.correlation-one.com/). Need less to say, I did not make it. However, I was challenged by one of their enrollement/assesment requirements. 

The question that I was required to answer was the following...

*How many loans were given for the Carlifornia State?*

I kept the _.csv_ data and managed to revisit it. Lets dive in:

## Loading the libraries

We will need Pandas, Matplotlib as well as some inbuilt Python functionality.


```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data=pd.read_csv('DS4A_data.csv')
data.head()
```

The data has seven columns. My first desire is to see how many states are in this data set.


```python
state_list=[]
for index, row in data.iterrows():
    if row['OFFICE_LOCATION'] not in state_list:
        state_list.append(row['OFFICE_LOCATION'])
```


```python
state_list
```




    ['NORTHERN CALIFORNIA',
     'SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA',
     'ARIZONA',
     'OREGON',
     'WASHINGTON STATE',
     'NEVADA']



## Number of Loans per State

It appears the data has only six states. Now let us find out how many  loans were awarded per state. We will use a dictionary to store the results as follows:


```python
loan_num_per_state = {}

for index, row in data.iterrows():
    if row['OFFICE_LOCATION'] in loan_num_per_state:
        loan_num_per_state[row['OFFICE_LOCATION']]+=1
    else:
        loan_num_per_state[row['OFFICE_LOCATION']]=1
```


```python
loan_num_per_state
```




    {'NORTHERN CALIFORNIA': 1715,
     'SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA': 2096,
     'ARIZONA': 1621,
     'OREGON': 755,
     'WASHINGTON STATE': 774,
     'NEVADA': 1039}



### Plotting the Results:

While the dictionary above is clear, we would like to plot a bar graph of the data. This will make the information easier to interpret. One problem that arose was that the state names were overlapping and not readable. The *rotation* option enables us to slant the column names to our desired angle. Beautiful....


```python
plt.plot()
plt.bar(range(len(loan_num_per_state)), list(loan_num_per_state.values()), align='center')
plt.xticks(range(len(loan_num_per_state)), list(loan_num_per_state.keys()), rotation=70)
plt.xlabel('States')
plt.ylabel('Number of Loans awarded')
plt.show()
```

## Analysing Existing Debt

In the Pandas dataframe I noticed that there was a column for existing debt. Using a similar approach as above, I obtained a dictionary for the various debt categories. As expected, the majority of the loans awarded were to people who had a low existing debt or non at all. Here we assumed that *nan* meant they had none.


```python
loan_existing_debt = {}

for index, row in data.iterrows():
    if row['EXISTING_DEBT'] in loan_existing_debt:
        loan_existing_debt[row['EXISTING_DEBT']]+=1
    else:
        loan_existing_debt[row['EXISTING_DEBT']]=1
```


```python
plt.plot()
plt.bar(range(len(loan_existing_debt)), list(loan_existing_debt.values()), align='center')
plt.xticks(range(len(loan_existing_debt)), list(loan_existing_debt.keys()), rotation=70)
plt.xlabel('Previous Debt')
plt.ylabel('Number of Loans awarded')
plt.show()
```

## Creating Functions:

It would be interesting to get the relationship between number of loans awared, total loan value and the loan averge by state. However, it would be better to create a function to capture all the operations for repeatability.


```python
def loan_data_by_state(info, state):
    state_stats = {'Num_Loans': 0, 'Total_Loans': 0, 'Average_loan': 0}
    for index, row in info.iterrows():
        if row['OFFICE_LOCATION'] == state:
            state_stats['Num_Loans']+=1
            state_stats['Total_Loans']+=row['LOAN_AMOUNT']             
    state_stats['Average_loan'] = state_stats['Total_Loans']/state_stats['Num_Loans']
    return state_stats
```


```python
def loan_vs_default_by_state(info, state):
    state_stats = {'Num_Loans': 0, 'Num_Defaulted': 0}
    for index, row in info.iterrows():
        if row['OFFICE_LOCATION'] == state:
            state_stats['Num_Loans']+=1
            if row['DEFAULTED']=='False':
                state_stats['Num_Defaulted']+=1                
    return state_stats
```


```python
loan_data_per_state={}
for state_ in state_list:
    loan_data_per_state[state_]=loan_data_by_state(data,state_)
```


```python
loan_data_per_state
plt.xlabel('States')
plt.ylabel('Number of Loans awarded')
```




    {'NORTHERN CALIFORNIA': {'Num_Loans': 1715,
      'Total_Loans': 11324600,
      'Average_loan': 6603.265306122449},
     'SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA': {'Num_Loans': 2096,
      'Total_Loans': 13573600,
      'Average_loan': 6475.954198473282},
     'ARIZONA': {'Num_Loans': 1621,
      'Total_Loans': 10612900,
      'Average_loan': 6547.131400370142},
     'OREGON': {'Num_Loans': 755,
      'Total_Loans': 4713900,

     'WASHINGTON STATE': {'Num_Loans': 774,
      'Total_Loans': 5034600,
      'Average_loan': 6504.6511627906975},
     'NEVADA': {'Num_Loans': 1039,
      'Total_Loans': 6758500,
      'Average_loan': 6504.812319538018}}




```python
loan_default_per_state={}
for state_ in state_list:
    loan_default_per_state[state_]=loan_vs_default_by_state(data,state_)
```


```python
loan_default_per_state
```




    {'NORTHERN CALIFORNIA': {'Num_Loans': 1715, 'Num_Defaulted': 0},
     'SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA': {'Num_Loans': 2096, 'Num_Defaulted': 0},
     'ARIZONA': {'Num_Loans': 1621, 'Num_Defaulted': 0},
     'OREGON': {'Num_Loans': 755, 'Num_Defaulted': 0},
     'WASHINGTON STATE': {'Num_Loans': 774, 'Num_Defaulted': 0},
     'NEVADA': {'Num_Loans': 1039, 'Num_Defaulted': 0}}



# Conclusion

I still have a lot to learn, and would appreciate another chance at the [DS4A](https://c1-web.correlation-one.com/ds4a-empowerment) Fellowship. However, it is not offered to people outside the United States.

Still, I am grateful.
